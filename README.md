## 🛠️ How to Use and Customize

Follow these simple steps to set up and personalize your new portfolio template:

### 1. **Download the Template**

Download the entire project folder from Envato.

### 2. **Open in Your Code Editor**

Unzip the downloaded file and open the project folder in your favorite code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).

### 3. **Customize Content (`index.html`)**

- **Your Name:** Update `"Rohan Sharma"` in the `h1` tag in the `index.html` file (specifically, the `nameToType` variable in `script.js` also controls the animated text).
- **About Section:** Modify the text in the "About Me" section (`#about`).
- **Skills:** Update your skills in the "Skills" section (`#skills`). Each skill can be an `img` tag with a caption.
- **Projects:** Replace the placeholder project details (`#projects`) with your own. Ensure you update titles, descriptions, and links.
- **Services:** Adjust the service descriptions (`#services`) to reflect what you offer.
- **Contact Information:** Update the email, phone, and social media links in the "Contact" section (`#contact`) and the footer.
- **Resume:** Replace `assets/resume-rohan-sharma.pdf` with your actual PDF resume. Update the `href` in the "Download Resume" button.
- **Images:** Replace `assets/images/Rohan-Sharma.jpg` with your profile picture. Update other image paths as needed.

### 4. **Customize Styling (`styles.css` & `tailwind.config.js`)**

- **Colors:** The primary colors are defined in `tailwind.config.js` within `index.html` (under `<script> tailwind.config = {...}`):
  - `bg: "#111111"` (background)
  - `text: "#ffffff"` (primary text)
  - `accent: "#ff004f"` (highlight/accent color)
    You can easily change these values to match your brand.
- **Fonts:** Google Fonts are linked in the `<head>` of `index.html`. You can modify the `fontFamily` in `tailwind.config.js` to use different fonts.
- **Custom CSS:** For more specific styling adjustments, use `styles.css`. This file is already linked and ready for your custom rules.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For fine-grained control over layout and component styling, refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation and directly modify the utility classes in `index.html`.

### 5. **Customize JavaScript (`script.js`)**

- **Typewriter Effect:**
  - `nameToType`: Change `"Rohan Sharma"` to your name.
  - `typingSpeed`, `erasingSpeed`, `delayBeforeErase`, `delayBeforeType`: Adjust these variables to control the speed and timing of the typing and erasing animation.
- **Lottie Animations:**
  - The background bubble animation uses a Lottie JSON file. You can replace `https://assets4.lottiefiles.com/packages/lf20_tll0j4bb.json` with your own Lottie animation URL.
  - Similarly, for the contact section, update the `path` for `contact-lottie`.

### 6. **Deployment**

- This is a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website. You can host it on any static hosting service like:

  - GitHub Pages (as demonstrated by the live demo link)
  - Netlify
  - Vercel
  - Firebase Hosting
  - Any traditional web server (Apache, Nginx)

  Simply upload the entire project folder to your hosting provider.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Contact Form:** The contact form is purely a UI (User Interface). To make it send emails, you will need to integrate it with a backend service (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms, custom server-side script with Node.js, PHP, etc.). This template _does not_ include backend functionality.
- **Resume & Profile Picture:** Remember to replace the placeholder `resume-rohan-sharma.pdf` and `Rohan-Sharma.jpg` with your actual files.
- **External Libraries:** This template uses CDN links for AOS, Lottie, and Tailwind CSS. While convenient, for production, you might consider self-hosting these libraries for better control and performance, especially if you plan extensive custom builds.
- **AOS Initialization:** There are two AOS initialization scripts in `index.html`. You only need one. It's recommended to keep the one inside the `DOMContentLoaded` listener in `script.js` or directly before the closing `</body>` tag if you separate it, ensuring it runs after the DOM is fully loaded. (The current `script.js` already includes `AOS.init()` inside `DOMContentLoaded` so you can remove the other instances).
  ```html

  ```
  _(Self-correction: The provided `index.html` has two `AOS.init()` calls. The one inside `script.js` is better placed. You should remove the redundant ones in `index.html` to avoid conflicts.)_
